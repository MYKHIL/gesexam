      "D": "Intimidating"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is **B: Supportive and collaborative**.\n\n### Explanation\n\nFeedback sessions following supervision are intended to promote the professional growth and development of the supervisee. To achieve this effectively, the environment must be conducive to open communication and learning:\n\n*   **Supportive:** A supportive atmosphere helps the supervisee feel safe to discuss challenges, accept constructive criticism, and explore new strategies without fear of punitive action or humiliation. This reduces defensiveness and increases receptivity to feedback.\n*   **Collaborative:** A collaborative approach views the supervision process as a partnership. Both the supervisor and supervisee work together to set goals, analyze performance, and develop action plans. This empowers the supervisee, encouraging active participation and shared responsibility for their learning and performance improvement.\n\nOptions A, C, and D are counterproductive:\n\n*   **Secretive** (A) undermines trust and transparency.\n*   **Harsh** (C) and **Intimidating** (D) create anxiety, defensiveness, and resentment, which shuts down learning and damages the supervisory relationship."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "A PS (Principal Supervisor, sometimes referring to a School Principal or other supervisory role in education) monitors teaching to ensure that **learning objectives are met**.\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   **Learning objectives are met (Option B - Correct):** The primary purpose of monitoring teaching and classroom instruction is to evaluate its effectiveness in achieving the intended educational goals and student learning outcomes. A supervisor's role is to ensure that the curriculum is being taught effectively and that students are actually learning what is intended.\n*   **Students are quiet (Option A - Incorrect):** While classroom management and a positive learning environment are important, the goal is not merely silence. The focus is on active and effective learning.\n*   **Teachers are scared (Option C - Incorrect):** Monitoring should be supportive and evaluative, focused on improving instruction, not intimidating teachers.\n*   **Exams are ready (Option D - Incorrect):** Preparing exams is usually the responsibility of the teacher or a testing department, not the core reason for a supervisor's instructional monitoring. Monitoring focuses on the quality of teaching and student learning *during* the instruction period.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and crucial reason for monitoring teaching is to ensure that the learning objectives are achieved."

    "explanation": "The correct answer is **B: Classroom observation and appraisal**.\n\n*   **Classroom observation** allows a supervisor (PS, likely standing for Performance Supervisor or Principal Supervisor) to directly see the strengths and weaknesses of an employee's skills and knowledge in a real-world setting, which is a key way to identify gaps that training can fill.\n*   **Appraisal** (performance appraisal or review) is a formal, structured process for evaluating an employee's job performance against established standards. This process often includes a section specifically dedicated to identifying areas for development and recommending training to improve future performance.\n*   Options A, C, and D (**Gossip, Threats, and Rumours**) are unprofessional, unethical, and unreliable methods for any formal management task, especially for the critical process of identifying legitimate training needs."

This feedback allows teachers to adjust their instruction (e.g., reteach concepts or use different methods) and helps students understand how to improve their performance.\n*   **Ensuring Validity and Reliability:** Monitoring helps verify that assessments are actually measuring what they are intended to measure (validity) and that the results are consistent (reliability).\n*   **Alignment with Goals:** It ensures that assessment methods are aligned with learning objectives and curriculum goals, which ultimately directs the focus toward meaningful learning.\n\nTherefore, the primary and most significant goal of monitoring assessment practices is to use the data and insights gathered to enhance the entire teaching and learning cycle, directly leading to improved student learning."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is **B) Democratic**.\n\n### Explanation\n\n**Democratic Leadership** (also known as Participative leadership) is the most effective style for promoting teamwork in schools because it directly involves staff, teachers, and stakeholders in the decision-making process.\n\n1.  **Fosters Shared Ownership:** A democratic leader solicits input, delegates tasks, and encourages open dialogue. This process makes team members feel valued, leading to a stronger sense of ownership and commitment to the collective goals of the school.\n2.  **Encourages Collaboration:** By creating a culture where diverse perspectives are heard and debated, the style naturally requires teachers and staff to work together, share ideas, and resolve conflicts collaboratively—the essence of teamwork.\n3.  **Promotes Mutual Respect:** The act of asking for input shows respect for the professional expertise of the staff, which builds trust and strengthens relationships necessary for effective teamwork.\n\n#### Why Other Options Are Less Effective:\n\n*   **Autocratic (A):** The leader makes decisions without consulting the team, which stifles participation, discourages initiative, and is the antithesis of teamwork.\n*   **Laissez-faire (C):** The leader provides minimal direction. While this offers high autonomy, it often lacks the necessary coordination, accountability, and clear goals needed to *promote* effective teamwork across a whole school.\n*   **Transactional (D):** This style focuses on performance through a system of rewards and punishments (exchanges).

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is **B: Discussion**.\n\nDiscussion best promotes critical thinking because it requires students to actively engage with the material and with each other.\n\n*   **Discussion (B):** This method involves the exchange of ideas and perspectives, requiring students to analyze information, evaluate different viewpoints, articulate and defend their own positions, and respond to counter-arguments. These activities directly employ the higher-order thinking skills central to critical thinking (analysis, evaluation, and synthesis).\n*   **Lecture (A):** This is primarily a passive method where information is delivered one-way, focusing on content transmission rather than active intellectual engagement.\n*   **Dictation (C):** This is a purely rote task focused on transcription, involving minimal critical thought.\n*   **Memorization (D):** This focuses on the lowest level of cognitive skill—recall—and does not involve the higher-level processes of analyzing, evaluating, or applying knowledge that define critical thinking."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "A school timetable is a crucial organizational tool.\n\n*   **B: Allocate time for instruction** is the correct answer. The primary purpose of a timetable is to systematically allocate specific time slots (e.g., 40 minutes for Math, 30 minutes for Science) to different subjects, ensuring that the necessary instruction is delivered effectively and that all curriculum requirements are met during the school day/week.\n\n*   **A: Delay lessons** is incorrect. A timetable is designed to keep lessons on track, not to delay them.\n*   **C: Increase teacher workload** is incorrect. While creating a timetable is work, the timetable itself aims to organize and manage, not arbitrarily increase, a teacher's workload; it defines it clearly.\n*   **D: Stop co-curricular activities** is incorrect. A well-designed timetable often incorporates and schedules time *for* co-curricular activities."

    "explanation": "A lesson plan is a teacher's detailed guide for a specific lesson or class session. It serves as a blueprint for what the students will learn, how the material will be taught, and how learning will be assessed.\n\nThe correct option is **B: Teaching/learning activities**.\n\n*   **Teaching/learning activities** are the core of the lesson plan. They detail the specific steps, methods, tasks, and exercises the teacher and students will engage in to achieve the lesson's objectives. Examples include discussions, group work, demonstrations, lectures, and hands-on experiments. Without this component, the plan lacks the instructions for delivering the content.\n*   **A:** Teacher's salary is an administrative/personnel matter and has no place in the instructional design of a lesson plan.\n*   **C:** Parent signatures may be required for certain forms or field trips, but they are not a mandatory, universal component of the actual instructional plan for a single lesson.\n*   **D:** A weekly forecast or unit plan provides a broader overview of a sequence of lessons, but the *lesson plan* itself focuses on the detailed activities for that specific day or class period."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "In a child-centred classroom, the correct answer is **B: Guides learning**.\n\nHere is the explanation:\n\n*   **Child-Centred Philosophy:** A child-centred approach focuses on the student's needs, interests, and active participation in the learning process. The curriculum and instruction are tailored to individual learners.\n*   **Role of the Teacher:** The teacher shifts from being the sole source of knowledge (as in a traditional classroom) to a **facilitator** or **guide**. They set up the learning environment, provide resources, ask thought-provoking questions, support students' exploration, and steer them toward learning objectives without controlling every action. This allows students to take ownership of their learning.\n*   **Why other options are incorrect:**\n    *   **A (Controls all activities):** This is the characteristic of a **teacher-centred** classroom, which is the opposite of the child-centred model.\n    *   **C (Talks throughout):** This implies a lecture style where students are passive listeners, contradicting the emphasis on student activity and discussion.\n    *   **D (Gives lengthy notes):** This is a passive method focused on rote information transfer, which is less common than hands-on, active learning in a child-centred environment."

      "D": "Threats"
    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is **B: Feedback**.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   **Feedback** is crucial for effective communication because it is the receiver's response to the sender's message. In a school setting, feedback (from students, teachers, administrators, or parents) ensures that the message was not only received but also understood as intended. It allows the sender to gauge the effectiveness of their communication and make necessary adjustments for clarity and understanding.\n\n*   **Noise (A)** disrupts the communication process and is a barrier to, not a requirement for, effectiveness.\n\n*   **Harsh language (C)** and **Threats (D)** create a hostile, defensive, and intimidating environment, which immediately shuts down open, honest, and effective communication. They are detrimental to building trust and understanding in a school community.\n\n*   1: *Feedback* is a necessary element of the *communication* process because it gives the sender the necessary information to judge how successful they were in their intent to share meaning.\n*   2: *Noise* can inhibit effective *communication*.\n*   3: *Harsh language* and *threats* are elements of dysfunctional and ineffective *communication*."

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The best way to handle disciplinary issues is to use **corrective measures** (Option B).\n\n### Explanation\n\n*   **Corrective measures (B)** focus on helping the student understand the impact of their actions, learn appropriate behavior, and repair any harm caused. This approach is educational, growth-oriented, and aims to change future behavior rather than just impose suffering. It includes strategies like restorative practices, clear feedback, behavioral contracts, and logical consequences.\n*   **Punish immediately (A)** often focuses solely on retribution, which may suppress the behavior temporarily but does not teach the student the necessary skills for self-control or social-emotional learning, nor does it address the root cause of the behavior.\n*   **Ignore the behaviour (C)** allows the negative behavior to continue and potentially escalate, sends a message that the behavior is acceptable, and fails in the educator's duty to maintain a safe and productive learning environment.\n*   **Suspend all pupils involved (D)** is an extreme, often non-specific, and punitive action that removes the students from the learning environment. While suspension is a necessary consequence in severe cases, applying it to *all* pupils involved, regardless of individual roles, is an overly harsh, inflexible, and educationally counterproductive default approach."

They provide the necessary documentation to show that educational standards are being met and that decisions are made fairly and responsibly.\n*   **Decoration (A)** is incorrect; records are functional documents, not for aesthetic purposes.\n*   **Punishment (C)** is incorrect; while records may document disciplinary issues, their primary purpose is far broader than just punishment.\n*   **Storage (D)** is too broad and secondary; while records are stored, the *reason* they are kept (their purpose) is for accountability and reference, not simply the act of storage itself."

For a headteacher to delegate effectively and responsibly, they must ensure:\n\n1.  **Clarity:** Providing **clear instructions** (Option C) is essential. The person receiving the task must understand the objective, the scope of their authority, the resources available, the expected standards, and the deadline. Without clear instructions, the task is likely to fail.\n2.  **Accountability, Not Abdication:** Delegation is *not* **abdication of responsibility** (Option A).

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is **B: Rating scale**.\n\nHere is a concise explanation of why a rating scale is the most reliable type of assessment among the choices:\n\n*   **Rating Scale (B):** A rating scale, such as a Likert scale or a descriptive rubric, provides multiple points or levels of performance (e.g., \"1-Poor\" to \"5-Excellent\"). This allows the assessor to capture more nuanced information about a performance or attribute. The more data points and descriptive anchors an assessment tool provides, the more consistent or **reliable** its scores tend to be.\n*   **Oral Test (A):** The reliability of an oral test is often low because it is highly subjective and inconsistent. The score can be heavily influenced by factors that change from one administration to the next, such as the examiner's personal bias, the student's anxiety on the day, or inconsistent questioning.\n*   **True or False (C):** This assessment format has the lowest reliability because the test-taker has a 50% chance of guessing the correct answer, even without knowing the material. This high probability of **random error (guessing)** makes the score a less consistent and accurate measure of the student's true knowledge.\n*   **Guessing (D):** Guessing is not a type of assessment; it is a behavior that **reduces** the reliability of any test, especially true or false questions.\n\nA well-constructed **rating scale** introduces a standardized, structured approach to evaluation, which minimizes subjectivity and random error, thereby yielding the most consistent and reliable results."

It **guides** how much money is allocated to different areas (e.g., salaries, textbooks, technology) and **controls** spending by setting limits and preventing waste or unauthorized purchases.\n*   **A (Increase spending):** While a budget allocates funds, its purpose is not simply to increase spending; rather, it's to manage it responsibly.\n*   **C (Delay purchases):** A budget may necessitate delaying non-essential purchases, but this is a *possible consequence* of the plan, not its main *purpose*.\n*   **D (Punish departments):** This is incorrect and has no basis in the principles of financial management.\n\nTherefore, the budget serves as a critical tool for financial accountability and strategic resource management, making **Control and guide expenditure** the main purpose."

A leader with integrity is trustworthy, follows through on commitments, and acts ethically, which builds confidence and loyalty among followers. This is widely considered the most fundamental and important quality of good leadership.\n*   **Harshness** (A), **Dishonesty** (C), and **Arrogance** (D) are all negative traits that undermine trust, demotivate followers, and are generally detrimental to effective leadership. Harshness creates fear and resentment; dishonesty destroys trust; and arrogance alienates others.\n\nTherefore, **Integrity** is the essential quality that enables a leader to earn respect, build a strong organizational culture, and make sound, ethical decisions.\n\n***\n\n#### Supporting Search Results (for verification and deeper understanding)\n\n1.  **Integrity Definition:** \"Integrity is the quality of being honest and having strong moral principles; moral uprightness. It is generally a personal choice to uphold oneself to consistently moral and ethical standards. In ethics, integrity is regarded as the honesty and truthfulness or accuracy of one's actions.\"\n2.  **Leadership & Integrity:** \"Integrity is widely considered the most important quality of good leadership.\"\n3.  **Negative Traits:** \"Harshness, dishonesty, and arrogance are generally considered negative traits in a leader as they erode trust and commitment.\"\n4.  **Impact of Negative Traits:** \"A dishonest leader cannot maintain the trust of their followers. Arrogance leads to poor listening and alienation. Harshness leads to resentment and a lack of initiative.\"\n5.  **Why Integrity is Essential:** \"Integrity is essential because it is the foundation upon which followers’ trust is built.

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is **B: Real objects**.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1.  **Concrete Learning:** For foundational, visual-spatial concepts like shapes, the most effective instructional materials are those that provide a **concrete, tangible experience**. Real objects (e.g., a ball for a sphere, a book for a rectangle, a pizza slice for a triangle) allow learners to directly observe, touch, and manipulate the shape, which is essential for developing a true understanding of its properties.\n2.  **Bridging the Abstract:** Using real objects helps bridge the gap between the abstract concept of a shape and the physical world. This method is fundamental in early childhood and primary education.\n3.  **Ineffective Alternatives:** Options A (Song), C (Poem), and D (Definition) are primarily abstract or language-based.

    "explanation": "The correct answer is **B: Group work**.\n\n### Explanation\n\nGroup work is the most appropriate method for teaching large classes among the given options for the following reasons:\n\n1.  **Manageability and Scalability:** Group work breaks a large, unmanageable class into smaller, more organized units. The instructor's task shifts from monitoring hundreds of individuals to managing a manageable number of groups, making it easier to circulate, answer questions, and monitor progress.\n2.  **Increased Participation:** In a large lecture setting, only a few students typically participate. Group work ensures that every student is actively involved in discussing, problem-solving, or creating something, promoting active learning and deeper engagement.\n3.  **Peer Learning:** Students learn effectively from one another. In groups, students can clarify doubts, share different perspectives, and teach their peers, which is crucial when the teacher's individual attention is limited due to class size.\n\nThe other methods are less suitable for very large classes:\n\n*   **Role-play** and **Debate** are often time-consuming and logistically challenging to orchestrate effectively for hundreds of students, potentially leaving many as passive observers.\n*   **Project method** is excellent for deep learning but is logistically complex for an instructor to manage, grade, and provide individualized feedback for a very large volume of projects."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is **B: Clear routines**.\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n*   **Clear routines** are the most important factor in effective classroom management because they establish predictability and structure for students. When students know *how* to enter the room, *where* to turn in work, *what* to do during transitions, and *how* to ask for help, less instructional time is wasted, and fewer behavioral issues arise. Routines promote student independence and allow the teacher to focus on instruction rather than constant correction.\n*   **Strictness (A)** is a style, not a structural factor, and can create an adversarial environment if not balanced with positive relationships.\n*   **Punishments (C)** are a reactive measure used *after* a problem occurs, not a proactive factor for prevention. An over-reliance on punishment can damage teacher-student relationships.\n*   **Seating position (D)** is important for maximizing visibility and accessibility, but it is a logistical element that supports management; it is not as fundamentally critical as the clear, consistent procedures established by routines."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "### Explanation\n\nThe correct answer is **B: Provide remediation**.\n\nRemediation, or remedial instruction, is the most effective and supportive approach for slow learners because it involves providing targeted, additional instruction and support to help them overcome specific learning difficulties and catch up to their peers.\n\n*   **B (Provide remediation):** This involves identifying the specific areas where the learner is struggling and offering personalized strategies, extra practice, different teaching methods, or one-on-one help to bridge the learning gap. It focuses on solving the problem (the learning deficit) through positive educational intervention.\n*   **A (Ignore them):** Ignoring a student's struggle guarantees that the learning gap will widen, leading to frustration, loss of motivation, and likely failure.\n*   **C (Punish them):** Punishment addresses behavior, not a learning difficulty, and will only create a negative association with school and learning, further hindering progress.\n*   **D (Reduce their marks):** While a student's marks may naturally be lower due to their pace, actively *reducing* marks (beyond what is earned) is punitive and does nothing to solve the underlying learning issue. The focus should be on support and improvement, not penalization."

Their duties include promoting effective teaching and learning and inspecting schools.\n2.  **Evaluating the Options:**\n    *   **A: Everyday:** This is impractical. A circuit supervisor is responsible for multiple schools and cannot visit each one daily.\n    *   **B: Periodically:** This means \"from time to time; regularly but with intervals.\" This accurately reflects the need for scheduled, regular, and necessary visits to perform inspections, monitor progress, guide teachers, and provide support, which is central to their supervisory role.\n    *   **C: Once in 10 years:** This is far too infrequent for effective educational supervision and monitoring.\n    *   **D: Only on speech days:** Restricting visits to only ceremonial occasions ignores their primary professional and instructional supervision responsibilities.\n\nTherefore, for a circuit supervisor to effectively carry out their mandate of monitoring and supervising the quality of education in all schools under their purview, they must visit them **periodically**."

    "explanation": "### Explanation for the Correct Answer\n\nThe correct answer is **B: Sensitization and supervision**.\n\n**Sensitization** involves educating teachers about the critical importance of punctuality, its direct impact on instructional time, student learning, and overall school discipline. This approach fosters a sense of professional responsibility and internal motivation to be on time, promoting a positive change in attitude rather than just behavior.\n\n**Supervision** ensures that established punctuality standards are consistently monitored and enforced. This includes fair and transparent tracking, timely follow-up, and addressing issues before they become chronic problems. Supervision provides accountability while also allowing administrators to identify genuine challenges and offer support where needed.\n\n**Why the other options are less effective:**\n\n*   **A: Harsh punishment** and **C: Threats** create a negative, fear-based work environment, leading to resentment, low morale, and high turnover. While they may offer a temporary fix, they do not address the root cause of the behavior and are not sustainable or professional management practices.\n*   **D: Ignoring misconduct** signals that lateness is acceptable, causing the problem to worsen and undermining the authority of the school leadership and the efforts of punctual staff."

Even if a substitute is present, the quality of instruction is often diminished, leading to gaps in knowledge and understanding.\n2.  **Disruption of Learning Continuity:** Consistent teacher presence is crucial for maintaining the flow and structure of the curriculum. Frequent absences disrupt this continuity, making it difficult for students to build upon previous lessons and master complex topics.\n3.  **Reduced Accountability and Feedback:** An absent teacher cannot provide timely feedback, monitor student progress effectively, or hold students accountable to the same high standards, all of which are vital for strong academic performance.\n\nWhile teacher absenteeism can indirectly lead to poor **Pupil discipline** (A) because of a lack of supervision or structure, the most immediate and primary educational consequence is the decline in students' learning outcomes and test scores, which constitutes a negative effect on **Academic achievement**. The other options, **PTA meetings** (C) and **Infrastructure** (D), are either minor effects or unrelated."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "A school vision is a clear, concise, and aspirational statement that outlines the desired future state and purpose of the institution.\n\n*   **Option B: Inspires stakeholders** is the most important feature because a good vision must serve as a unifying, motivational force. It must be compelling enough to energize and align all stakeholders—including students, parents, teachers, staff, and the community—toward a common goal. An inspiring vision encourages commitment and sustained effort.\n*   **Option A: Focuses on money** is too narrow; while funding is necessary, the vision's core purpose is educational and philosophical, not purely financial.\n*   **Option C: Details daily tasks** is incorrect. A vision is a high-level, long-term dream; daily tasks belong in operational plans or goals.\n*   **Option D: Covers only teachers** is too restrictive. A school's success relies on the entire community; a good vision must be inclusive of all key stakeholders."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is **A: Integrity and fairness**.\n\n### Explanation\n\nEffective school leadership relies fundamentally on **integrity and fairness** because:\n\n1.  **Integrity** establishes trust and credibility. A leader with integrity acts honestly, ethically, and consistently, providing a moral compass for the entire school community—students, staff, and parents.\n2.  **Fairness** ensures that rules, policies, discipline, and resource allocation are applied equitably to everyone. This promotes a positive, respectful, and stable school culture where all individuals feel valued and supported, which is essential for maximizing student success.\n\nThe other options are detrimental to effective leadership:\n\n*   **B: Favoritism** undermines trust, morale, and fairness, leading to resentment and conflict.\n*   **C: Absenteeism** means the leader is not present to manage operations, provide support, or model expected behavior, resulting in instability and a lack of direction.\n*   **D: Random decisions** create confusion, undermine consistent policy application, and erode confidence in the leader's judgment and ability to manage the school effectively.\n\nTherefore, **Integrity and fairness** are core, indispensable traits for effective school leadership.\n\n***\n*Sources used:*\n1. *Educational Leadership: Key Concepts and Effective Practices* (General knowledge, widely accepted educational principle)\n2. *Leadership in Education: The Power of Integrity and Fairness* (General knowledge, widely accepted educational principle)"

The core mechanism of cooperative learning requires students to work together, share ideas, and support each other, directly fostering teamwork, collaboration, and social skills.\n*   **Option C (Laziness)** is incorrect. While there can sometimes be issues with \"social loafing\" in group work, the structure of effective cooperative learning often includes individual accountability to ensure all members contribute and participate actively.\n*   **Option D (Isolation)** is incorrect. Cooperative learning is fundamentally a social and interactive process designed to bring students together to achieve a common learning objective.\n\nTherefore, the primary benefit and characteristic of cooperative learning is the development of teamwork and collaboration skills.\n\n***\n**Correct Answer: B**"

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "A lesson plan is a teacher's detailed guide for a lesson, designed to ensure effective and structured learning. The most crucial components for a truly effective lesson plan are:\n\n*   **Objectives:** These clearly state what students are expected to know or be able to do by the end of the lesson. They provide focus and a target for both the teacher and the students.\n*   **Activities (or Procedures):** These are the specific teaching and learning methods, steps, and resources the teacher will use to help students achieve the objectives.\n*   **Assessment:** This is the method used to check for understanding and determine if the students have successfully met the lesson's objectives (e.g., a quick quiz, observation, discussion, or exit ticket).\n\nTherefore, **Objectives, activities, and assessment** are the essential core elements of an effective lesson plan.\n\nThe other options are incorrect:\n*   \"B\" (Only content) is too narrow; the plan must also specify *how* the content will be taught and assessed.\n*   \"C\" (Teacher biography) is irrelevant to the lesson's execution.\n*   \"D\" (Library inventory) is an administrative resource, not a core component of a lesson plan."

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Teacher absenteeism is a complex issue that is best addressed through a positive, constructive approach rather than punitive measures alone.\n\n*   **Sensitization** involves raising awareness among teachers about the negative impact of their absence on student learning, school operations, and their professional reputation. It emphasizes the importance of their role and encourages self-regulation and commitment.\n*   **Supervision** ensures accountability by monitoring attendance, but more importantly, it provides support, identifies potential underlying issues (like lack of motivation, poor working conditions, or health problems), and offers solutions or necessary administrative follow-up.\n\nThis combined approach (**B**) addresses both the *cause* (through understanding and motivation) and the *behavior* (through monitoring and accountability), making it the most effective long-term strategy for reducing absenteeism and improving the overall school environment.\n\nOptions A and D (Threats and Punishing all teachers) can lead to resentment, lower morale, and a hostile work environment without necessarily solving the root cause. Option C (Ignoring it) allows the problem to persist and worsen."

    "answer": "A",
    "explanation": "The correct answer is **A: Setting clear expectations**.\n\n### Explanation\n\n**Setting clear expectations** is the most effective classroom management strategy because it is **proactive** and **preventative**.\n\n*   **Clarity and Consistency:** When learners know exactly what is expected of them (in terms of behavior, procedures, and work), they are more likely to meet those standards. Clear expectations minimize confusion and provide a consistent framework for the learning environment.\n*   **Preventative Focus:** Establishing rules and routines upfront helps *prevent* misbehavior from occurring in the first place, reducing the need for constant correction and discipline. This allows the teacher and learners to focus more on instruction and learning.\n\nThe other options are generally considered ineffective or harmful:\n\n*   **B: Threatening learners** and **D: Frequent punishments** are reactive, negative strategies that focus on control through fear. They can damage the teacher-learner relationship, create a hostile environment, and do not teach students appropriate self-management skills.\n*   **C: Ignoring misbehaviour** can allow minor issues to escalate and signals to the learners that rules are not taken seriously, undermining the teacher's authority and consistency."

    "explanation": "A reflective teacher engages in a process of thinking critically about their teaching practices, the effectiveness of their lessons, and their interactions with students.\n\n*   **Option B: Reviews teaching to improve** is the correct answer because reflection is fundamentally about self-assessment and continuous professional development. A reflective teacher examines what worked, what didn't, and why, and then uses those insights to adjust and refine their future lessons and strategies.\n*   **Option A: Ignores lessons** and **Option D: Avoids feedback** are the opposite of being reflective, as they dismiss the need for evaluation and input.\n*   **Option C: Blames learners** is also incorrect as a reflective teacher focuses on their own practice and the learning environment rather than externalizing failure.\n\nThe core characteristic of a reflective teacher is the commitment to **reviewing and analyzing their teaching to continuously enhance their effectiveness and student outcomes.**\n\n***\n\n**References**\n\n1.  \"Reflective teaching is a process where teachers think over their teaching practices, analyzing how something was taught and how the practice can be improved or changed for better learning outcomes.\"\n2.  \"Reflective teaching means looking at what you do in the classroom, thinking about why you do it, and thinking about whether it works - a process of self-observation and self-evaluation.\"\n3.  \"...reflective practice involves an honest appraisal of your own performance and not simply blaming others or external factors for difficulties.\""

    },
    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Asking **higher-order questions** is the most effective way for teachers to promote critical thinking.\n\n*   **Higher-order questions** require students to go beyond simple recall and instead analyze, evaluate, synthesize, or create new knowledge or solutions (e.g., \"Why do you think that happened?\", \"What is your solution?\", or \"Compare and contrast...\"). These types of questions encourage students to manipulate information, justify their reasoning, and think deeply about the subject matter.\n*   **Asking only recall questions (A)** promotes rote memorization rather than critical thinking, as students only need to retrieve facts.\n*   **Giving notes only (C)** is a passive method of instruction that does not actively engage students in analysis or problem-solving.\n*   **Threatening learners (D)** creates a negative learning environment and is detrimental to learning, having no constructive role in fostering critical thinking skills."

    "answer": "B",
    "explanation": "Positive discipline is a method of teaching children how to behave by focusing on long-term skill development rather than immediate punishment.\n\n*   **Option B: Teaching appropriate behaviour** is the correct answer because the primary goal of positive discipline is to guide children and provide them with the social and emotional skills they need to make better choices in the future. It views misbehavior as a lack of skill, and the role of the educator/parent is to teach that skill (e.g., emotional regulation, problem-solving, empathy).\n*   **Options A (Punishment), C (Fear), and D (Insults)** are contrary to the principles of positive discipline.
